## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Todo

- Show points on board on line clear.
- Upload to Netlify and link from readme.
- Highscore.
- Colors and shapes should not need empty first.
- Still some for-for loops.
- Services?
